# Equivalence-checker
Prototype of PRES+ Equivalence checkers



1. FSMDEQX.zip -- the FSMD equivalence checker (PE AND VP BASED) with which comparison has 
                      been made,

2. DCPEQXforAutomatedModels.zip -- the DCPEQX module + a front end 
                  for taking FSMD models and having them transformed to PRES+ 
                  mdoels through an automated model constructor.

3. SCPEQXforAutomatedModels.zip -- the SCPEQX module + a front end 
                  for taking FSMD models and having them transformed to PRES+ 
                  mdoels through an automated model constructor.



4. DCPEQX.zip -- DCPEQX module + hand constructed PRES+ models for both 
                 sequential and parallel examples (the source codes of the 
                 examples are in items 6 and 7)

5. SCPEQX.zip -- SCPEQX module + hand constructed PRES+ models for both 
                 sequential and parallel examples (the source codes of the 
                 examples are in items 6 and 7)


6. sequentialExamplesForOriginalAndTransformedSourceCodesOnly.zip -- 

7. parallelExamplesForOriginalAndTransformedSourceCodesOnly.zip -- 

8. thesisKulwant.pdf -- M. Tech. dissertation of Kulwant Singh on Automated 
                  model constructor (used here).
9.archive.zip -- All the equivalence checkers with a shell script which helps for running all examples.
